The dataset was sourced from an open source platform that I have used numerous time in the past called 'Kaggle"

the link for the dataset is as following:

https://www.kaggle.com/techzizou/labeled-mask-dataset-yolo-darknet

The folder contains the annotations and the bounding box/label text flies in the format needed by Yolo.

This format is different than waht Tensorflow models use which is the xml format.
