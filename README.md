# RealTime
Real-time object detection using Tensorflow and python.

7/9/21
This project is inspired by multiple YouTube videos and docunentation that will be posted in appropriate locations in this file

*** One of the things that I am looking forward to most is to make a video explanation of the build and implementation of this project because I personally tend to
have a bias towards video walkthroughs.

As an application of Computer Vision, this projec will be detecting an targeted object in a live video feed. One of the observations has been that the training in the instructions has been using very few images leading to unnderfitting.  I will be combining my project from previous semseter which was a binary classification problem on static labled data detecting the presence or absence of masks.

This project uses transfer learning techniques usiing the MobileNest SSD or single shot detector.
Steps:

1. Downloading and labeling dataset
2. Transfer Learning Using MobileNet SSD
3. Real time detection(webcam) using OpenCV
